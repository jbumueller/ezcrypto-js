h1. EzCrypto.js - Easy to use Crypto for JavaScript

This is a nice and usable DSL that wraps some JavaScript encryption libraries from some awesome folks:
  * "PidCrypt":https://www.pidder.com/pidcrypt/
  * "Tom Wu":http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/
  * "Unhosted":http://unhosted.org
  
I didn't write any of the encryption libraries, I just wrapped them in a nice and easy to understand DSL that is inspired by the "EzCrypto":http://ezcrypto.rubyforge.org/ Ruby gem.

**WARNING**: JavaScript crytography is still more or less the wild west. See "this article":http://rdist.root.org/2010/11/29/final-post-on-javascript-crypto for a pretty decent explanation of what you are getting yourself into. Use at your own risk.

h1. Example

When you load @ezcrypto.js@ it will include all of the JavaScript files in @vendor/@. In the future this might turn into one big CommonJS style module.

<pre>
  <code>
    <script src="ezcrypto.js"></script>
    
    // generate a public/private RSA keypair
    var keys = ezcrypto.generateKeys();
    => {"private": "3521df…", "public": "95d8cf…"}
    
    // AES encrypt your message, and then encrypt the AES key with your public RSA key
    var encryptedData = ezcrypto.encrypt('secrets', keys.public);
    => {"key": "8170f7…", "message": "72308a…"}
    
    // decrypt the encrypted data with your RSA keypair and AES key
    ezcrypto.decrypt(encryptedData.message, encryptedData.key, keys.public, keys.private));
    => 'secrets'
  </code>
</pre>

Open @test.html@ in a browser and check console output for a demo.
